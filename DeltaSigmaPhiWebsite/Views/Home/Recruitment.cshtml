                Introduction
            </h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Our recruitment process is values-based.  This means that our members make an intentional effort to get
                to know every potential new member before we extend a bid card (an invitation for membership).  
                Our goal is to build a group of very diverse individuals, all of which exhibit excellence in some way and share
                a vision for making themselves and the community a better place.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Each fraternity has a different culture and offers different experiences and friendships.
                That is why we encourage all potential new members to not only get to know us first, but to also get to know other fraternities.
                In other words, if Delta Sig isn't the right place for you, we will help you find a fraternity that is.
                We believe in the value of Greek Life that much, while also acknowledging that Greek Life isn't for everyone.
            </p>

                Getting in Touch
            </h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Many of our members were originally met within our classes, involvements, or existing social circles.
                However, potential new members have sought us out themselves, and we encourage you to do that if you do not know someone in Delta Sig.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                If you want to start getting to know us, introduce yourself by 
                <a href="@Url.Action("Contacts")">sending an email to our Director of Recruitment</a>. 
                Once we know you're out there, we can get you involved in Delta Sig however you want,
                whether it's answering your questions, touring the house, hanging out, or attending events.
