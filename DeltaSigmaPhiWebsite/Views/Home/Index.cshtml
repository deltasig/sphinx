                        Our recruitment process is <strong>values-based</strong> and we are proud of it.  For those who are right for Delta Sig, you already believe what we believe.

                        If Delta Sig isn't the right place for you, we will help you find a fraternity that is.

                    <p>
                        After a decade-long absence, Delta Epsilon has returned to Missouri S&amp;T and we have quickly risen to be one of the most influental student organizations on campus.
                        Our accomplishments are numerous, but none of it would be possible without generous support provided by our alumni.  That is why Delta Epsilon is committed to reconnecting with you.
