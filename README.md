#### Setup
When you first fork and clone the repository, you will need to build your database and seed it.  
The `Seed` method in `Migrations/Configuration.cs` contains some commented out code that serves as a good starting place.
If you are working with Ty on the Delta Sigma Phi website, ask him for an old copy of the production database for you to work with.
Otherwise, modify the code where `yourusername` is written how you see fit.  Then run the `Update-Database` command from the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio.

#### Feedback
