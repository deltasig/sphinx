# Sphinx

Sphinx is a collection of projects implementing a web application for managing Delta Sigma Phi (Delta Epsilon) fraternity operations.
It was started in January 2013 by Tyler (Ty) Morrow and first launched in Fall of 2014.

It unifies public web pages with private web pages (which require authentication) where custom, fraternity-centric features are implemented to streamline operations.
Some examples are:

- roster management
- laundry signup
- meal schedule
- room assignment
- house work orders
- and more

Public web pages also tie into the behind-the-scenes fraternity operations so that they can stay up-to-date (e.g., auto-updating the contacts page every semester based on the appointed leaders).
